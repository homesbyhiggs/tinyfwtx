      <h2>Why I’m Building This Park</h2>
      <p>
        In 2012 my mom lost our family home as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. She found stability in a tiny
        home, and I saw
        firsthand how lower housing costs create more certainty. I purchased the land where her home now sits and put in
        much of the work myself. That experience sparked a passion—I went on to build additional tiny homes, which grew
        into a small micro-resort. With 1,000+ nights hosted and 150+ five-star reviews, I’ve learned what truly makes
        tiny-home living affordable and sustainable in Fort Worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This park will exist to remove barriers for RVIA-certified tiny homes: utility-ready pads, clear rules, vetted
        transport/setup, and fast move-ins. You get predictable costs, transparent standards, and a local owner who’s
        been on both sides—resident and operator.

  <h2>Built for doers and downsizers</h2>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div>
      <h3>Young professionals</h3>
      <p>Keep monthly costs predictable, skip the maintenance of a traditional house, and focus on career and life.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Retirees</h3>
      <p>Right-size without giving up comfort—enjoy community, amenities, and flexibility if you ever want to move.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="lede">Own your home, not the headaches. Stop renting without building equity—and gain a neighborhood, not
    just a pad.</p>
