      <h2>Why I’m Building This Park</h2>
      <p>
        In 2012, my mom and I built her a tiny home after we lost ours. I learned two things: housing should be simple,
        and people deserve certainty.
        Since then I’ve developed a small micro‑resort of tiny homes—1,000+ nights hosted
        and 150+ five‑star reviews—learning exactly what makes tiny‑home living work in Fort Worth.
      <p></p>
      This park builds on that experience for RVIA‑certified and Park Model homes. You get utility‑ready pads, clear
      rules,
      vetted
      transport/setup partners, and quick move‑ins—so your costs are predictable and timelines are real.<p></p>
      I’m a local owner‑operator who’s been on both sides—resident and builder. If you want first pick and an early
      rate lock, join the Early Access list now. We’ll text you when Founders reservations open.

  <h2>Built for doers and downsizers</h2>
  <div class="grid-2">
    <div>
      <h3>Young professionals</h3>
      <p>Keep monthly costs predictable, skip the maintenance of a traditional house, and focus on career and life.</p>

      <h3>Retirees</h3>
      <p>Right-size without giving up comfort—enjoy community, amenities, and flexibility if you ever want to move.</p>

  <p class="lede">Own your home, not the headaches. Stop renting without building equity—and gain a neighborhood, not
    just a pad.</p>
